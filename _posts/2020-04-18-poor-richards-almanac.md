by Benjamin Franklin


Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.
He's a fool that makes his doctor his heir.
Half the truth is often a great lie.
Good sense is a thing all need, few have, and none think they want.
He that has not got a wife, is not yet a complete man.
He that falls in love with himself, will have no rivals.
He that lies down with dogs, shall rise up with fleas.
He that never eats too much, will never be lazy.
He that pays for work before it's done, has but a penny-worth for two pence.
He that speaks much, is much mistaken.
He that takes a wife, takes care.
He that would live in peace and at ease, must not speak all he knows, nor judge all he sees.
How few there are who have courage enough to own their faults.
If you know how to spend less than you get, you have the philisopher's stone.
If you would keep your secret from an enemy, tell it not to a friend.
If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth writing.
In success be moderate.
Lost time is never found again.
Love, and be loved. Observe all men; thyself most.
Ne'er take a wife till thou hast a house \(and a fire\) to put her in.
Most people return small favors, acknowledge middling ones, and repay great ones with ingratitude.
Money and good manners make the gentleman.
One to-day is worth two to-morrows.
Pay what you owe, and you'll know what's your own.
Rather go to bed supperless, than run in debt for a breakfast.
Reading makes a full man, meditation a profound man, discourse a clear man.
Read much, but not many books. Sell not virtue to purchase wealth, nor liberty to purchase power.
The bird that sits, is easily shot There are three faithful friends, an old wife, an old dog, and ready money.
The way to see by faith, is to shut the Eye of Reason.
The morning daylight appears plainer when you put out your candle.
To lengthen thy life, lessen thy meals Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.
Tim was so learned, that he could name a horse in nine languages.
So ignorant, that he bought a cow to ride on.
Well done is better than well said.
Well done, is twice done
