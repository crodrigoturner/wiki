He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often and loved much;  
Who has gained the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;  
Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;  
Who has left the world better than he found it, whether by an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;  
Who has never lacked appreciation of earth’s beauty or failed to express it;  
Who has always looked for the best in others and given the best he had;  
Whose life was an inspiration;  
Whose memory a benediction.  
– Bessie Anderson Stanley
