Don’t repeat yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with  
abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.  
The DRY principle is stated as “Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system”.
