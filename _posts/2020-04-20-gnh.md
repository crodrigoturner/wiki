In Buthan, GDP is not used to measure the country's prosperity, it is the GNH that lets them know how well the coutry is going.

New Zealand is planning to do something similar with a [Well being budget](https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/wellbeing-budget/wellbeing-budget-2019-html).

Buthan's [GNH Index](https://ophi.org.uk/policy/national-policy/gross-national-happiness-index/) \(Gross National Hapiness Index\) is based in 33 indicators from 9 domains, which are:

1. Psychological wellbeing
2. Health
3. Education
4. Time use
5. Cultural diversity and resilience
6. Good governance
7. Community vitality
8. Ecological diversity and resilience
9. Living standards

Another interesting fact from Buthan is that is the [only country with negative carbon emissions.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/asia/bhutan/carbon-negative-country-sustainability/)
