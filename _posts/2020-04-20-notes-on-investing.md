You don’t need a lot of money to start investing.

Start now.

Don’t check your investments everyday or even every week.

Automation = simplicity. Set up a recurring deposit and leave it.

Don’t try to time the market.

Understand that there’s no “magic solution” and this includes passive investing.

The best plan is the one you can stick with (consistency is everything).

General baseline expectation = 6-8% as a long term real return of equities.

Passively managed portfolios > actively managed portfolios.

Learn how (powerfully) compounding works for both investments and for debt.

Retirement savings isn’t just for your 40s and 50s.

What really matters is what you do in your 20s and 30s. Buy index funds or ETFs.

Fees make a big difference. Learn the priority pyramid – start at the bottom and work your way up.

Don’t jeopardize your savings/retirement plan by experimenting with stock picking.

If you want to buy individual stocks, open an account at a low cost custodian with <5% of your investable assets and learn by doing.

There is no better way to learn than by doing – even if it means losing some money.Have humility.
