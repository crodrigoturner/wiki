At the end of the day we only must answer to ourselves. (inner scorecard concept)  
Everything we do, we must do to have a clear conscience, first and foremost with ourselves.  
In the best and worst moments, the fact that we have done things correctly will allow us to be calm. It is something that nobody can take away from us.
