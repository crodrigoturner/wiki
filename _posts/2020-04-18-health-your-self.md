2. When it comes to changing your lifestyle and choosing to live more healthily, having a strong intrinsic motivation is critical to your success.
3. Food for your bones Focus on lean proteins, good fats, colourful fruit and veges. Include good sources of calcium, like dairy and tinned fish (with the bones). Eat a variety of foods – don’t restrict your diet or focus on one type of food. Keep it unprocessed – you’ll get far more of the nutrients you need and much less of the salt you don’t need. Get regular exposure to the sun – without risking sunburn. Sunscreen will stop vitamin D being made, so make sure to get some of your sun exposure when the UV index is low enough to go outside without protection.

When they get the go-ahead from your body, the satellite cells start multiplying.
7. The average human heart will beat 2.5 billion times during a lifetime.
