In North Korea there is no internet access as we know it in the rest of the world.There, only a few (high connected) can access the global Internet.  
The rest of North Koreans access  *Kwangmyong*  an intranet composed of between [ 1000 and 5500 websites ](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/02/23/north_korea_where_the_internet_has_just_5500_sites.html) based on news, social networks, some international articles on science (previously reviewed) and government portals.  
Only foreigners have access to the 3G Network, the rest use a state network.
