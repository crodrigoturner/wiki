1\. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.  
2\. Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.  
3\. Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.  
Douglas Admas is mostly known for the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
