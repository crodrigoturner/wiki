Written by Derren Brown

1. We are, each of us, a product of the stories we tell ourselves.
2. ‘The greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of the parents,’ wrote the legendary psychoanalyst Carl Jung.
3. ‘What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgements about these things.’
4. Out There and In Here are two very different kingdoms, and other people are not accountable for how we feel. No one, however ludicrously they behave, has the right or the direct means to affect your self-control or dignity.
5. Schopenhauer wrote, ‘Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world.’
6. Philosophers – literally ‘lovers of wisdom’
