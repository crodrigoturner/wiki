### Blockchain
1. A continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains typically a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data.

2. An open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

#### Bitcoin
Decentralized (global), democratized, highly secure cryptocurrency based on the blockchain.

A large network of computers validates and records all financial transactions in an open ledger that is secure from tampering. Those who help execute these transactions and maintain this ledger by offering computational power, receive Bitcoin in exchange for their services; much like a bank might take a commission for processing a payment.
