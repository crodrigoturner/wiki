Predicting how happy you will be in the future contingent upon some event or change is hard. We normally guess that the magnitude of the effect will be larger than it actually is, because ) weâ€™ve just been asked to think about that event, which makes it seem more important than it actually is in our everyday happiness, and ) we underestimate our ability to adapt.
