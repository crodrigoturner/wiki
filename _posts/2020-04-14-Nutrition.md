### Nutrition restriction

>It comes down to three forms of restriction. Whether it’s what you eat or don’t eat (dietary restriction), how much you eat (caloric restriction), or when you eat and don’t eat (time restriction), virtually all of the dietary schemes you can think of can be distilled into these three elements in some combination.
