- __Schofield's First Law of Computing__: Never put data into a program unless you can see exactly how to get it out.
- __Schofield's Second Law of Computing__: Data doesn't really exist unless you have at least two copies of it.
- __Schofield's Third Law of Computing__: The easier it is for you to access your data, the easier it is for someone else to access your data.
