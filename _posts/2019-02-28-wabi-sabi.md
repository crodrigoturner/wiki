It means beauty in that which is temporary or imperfect. Things that come off of an assembly line, for example, are perfect, but things made by hand, like the glaze on a Japanese ceramic bowl, are imperfect. It is their imperfections that give them their beauty.Another example is the cracks filled with bright colours of a broken bowl or vase, that are used to highlight the imperfections or scars of the bowl, but also itâ€™s history.The same is true for people. It is the combination of all of our imperfections that make us vulnerable and beautiful.
