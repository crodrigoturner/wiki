The bear market definition is exactly the opposite of a bull market.

It’s a market where quarter after quarter and the market is moving down about 20 percent.

That signals a bear market, and when that happens people start to get really scared about putting money into the stock market.

That’s because they don’t know how to invest Rule \#1 style.
