Aristotle \\(384–322 B.C.E.\\) created the term in his Metaphysics, by joining εν \\(in\\) and \\(work\\) to form \\(energeia, “actuality, identified with movement”\\)  
The law of conservation of energy – that energy can be neither created nor destroyed – is now commonly known as the first law of thermodynamics.  
Entropy – from the Greek\\(transformation\\) – to measure the degree of disorder in a closed system.  
The second law of thermodynamics, the universal tendency toward heat death and disorder.  
The third law of thermodynamics.  
All processes come to a stop \\(and entropy shows no change\\) only when the temperature nears absolute zero \\(–273 °C\\).  
E = mc2 – energy is equal to the product of mass and the square of the speed of light.  
Uranium 235 releases an amount of energy equivalent to 190 tonnes of crude oil
