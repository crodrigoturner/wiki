Objectives and key results (OKR) is a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.  
The development of OKRs is generally attributed to Andy Grove the «Father of OKRs», who introduced the approach to Intel during his tenure there and documented this in his 1983 book High Output Management.  
OKRs comprise an objective—a clearly defined goal—and one or more key results—specific measures used to track the achievement of that goal. The goal of OKR is to define how to achieve objectives through concrete, specific and measurable actions. Key results can be measured on a 0-100% scale or any numerical unit (e.g. dollar amount, %, items, etc.). Objectives should also be supported by initiatives, which are the plans and activities that help to achieve the objective and move forward the key results.
