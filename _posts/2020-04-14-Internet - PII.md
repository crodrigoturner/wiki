Information that, when used alone or with other relevant data, can identify an individual. 

PII may contain direct identifiers (e.g., passport information) that can identify a person uniquely, or quasi-identifiers (e.g., race) that can be combined with other quasi-identifiers (e.g., date of birth) to successfully recognize an individual.

Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that, when used alone or with other relevant data, can identify an individual.

Sensitive personally identifiable information can include your full name, Social Security Number, driverâ€™s license, financial information, and medical records.

Non-sensitive personally identifiable information is easily accessible from public sources and can include your zip code, race, gender, and date of birth.
