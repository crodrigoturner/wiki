Breakthroughs in applied physics have enabled scientists to create a stable and versatile quantum computer with far-reaching capabilities.   
Its enormous processing power quickly crunches numbers into prime factors, cracking even the most secure systems and messages encrypted with outdated algorithms.    
Traditional cryptography is likewise being replaced by the quantum sort, which in turn is opening up new possibilities in the field of communications and information security.   
Stable quantum computers have revolutionized the sphere of artificial intelligence, since they are able to process vast amounts of data in one quick operation and simulate neural networks of exponential size.   
Advanced neural networks calculate complex chemical reactions and molecular interactions, which allows scientists to create new materials and medicines.    
By 2040, quantum computers are becoming available to the masses both via the cloud and as physical units.
