The future reflects many of the stories that are commonplace in our traditional religions: life after death, out of body experiences, disease eradication, solving paralysis, super-intelligence, telepresence, etc.. 

Is this coincidence, is it our human nature to seek solutions to these problems? 

How do religions react when ancient "miracles" become commonplace?
