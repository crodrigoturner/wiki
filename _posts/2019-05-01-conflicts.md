There have always been conflicts:  
Between the rich and the poor (those who have and those who donâ€™t)  
Between capitalism and socialism (right and left)  
Between old and young  
Between men and women  
Between races  
Between freedom and internal or external threats (wars)  
Between governments and different forms of society  
There have always been and will be conflicts.
