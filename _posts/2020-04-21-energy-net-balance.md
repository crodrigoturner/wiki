The sun radiates more energy to the Earth in a couple hours than all of humanity consumes from all sources each year.

We also sometimes forget that the sun already powers almost everything on Earth. The sun powers the weather, causing wind, precipitation, and warmth to exist; it's the original source of all fossil fuel energy; and it powers the whole biosphere and its murder/theft cycle. Harnessing solar energy just cuts out various middlemen and goes straight to the source.
