Aberdeen Philosophical Society \[Wise Club\] (act. 1758–1773), was the most important forum for the promotion of enlightened thought and values in eighteenth-century Aberdeen.

The society’s meetings typically combined conviviality with serious intellectual exchange.

A disproportionately large number of the discourses and questions considered by the society addressed the philosophical writings of David Hume.
