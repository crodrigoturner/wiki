Aristotle \(384–322 B.C.E.\) created the term in his Metaphysics, by joining εν \(in\) and \(work\) to form \(energeia, “actuality, identified with movement”\)

The law of conservation of energy – that energy can be neither created nor destroyed – is now commonly known as the first law of thermodynamics.

Entropy – from the Greek\(transformation\) – to measure the degree of disorder in a closed system.

The second law of thermodynamics, the universal tendency toward heat death and disorder,

The third law of thermodynamics,

all processes come to a stop \(and entropy shows no change\) only when the temperature nears absolute zero \(–273 °C\).

E = mc2 – energy is equal to the product of mass and the square of the speed of light.

Uranium 235 releases an amount of energy equivalent to 190 tonnes of crude oil
