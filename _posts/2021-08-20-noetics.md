The term itself means «the proper exercise of nous» whereas nous («mind, understanding, intellect») is described as «the highest faculty in man, through which – provided it is purified – he knows God or the inner essences or principles of created things by means of direct apprehension or spiritual perception».

Noetic sciences can be defined as «how beliefs, thoughts, and intentions affect the physical world».
