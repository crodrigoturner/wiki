### Q.A.L.Y (Quality Adjusted Life Year)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year

A year of life lived in perfect health is worth 1 QALY (1 year of life Ã— 1 Utility value)

The quality-adjusted life year or quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a generic measure of disease burden, including both the quality and the quantity of life lived. It is used in economic evaluation to assess the value for money of medical interventions.
One QALY equates to one year in perfect health.
