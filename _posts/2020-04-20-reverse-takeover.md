A reverse takeover or reverse merger takeover (reverse IPO) is the acquisition of a public company by a private company so that the private company can bypass the lengthy and complex process of going public.

The transaction typically requires reorganization of capitalization of the acquiring company.

Sometimes, conversely, the private company is bought by the public listed company through an asset swap and share issue.
