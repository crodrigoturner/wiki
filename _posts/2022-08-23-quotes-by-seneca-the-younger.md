“Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.”

“True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.”

“There are more things that frighten us than injure us, and we suffer more in imagination than in reality.”

“As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.”

“It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor. ”

“It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much… The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill-provided but use what we have wastefully.”

“We should love all our dear ones… but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever—nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long.”

“Begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life.”

“He who is brave is free.”
