Money is plentiful for those who understand the simple rules of its acquisition:  
1\. Start thy purse to fattening  
2\. Control thy expenditures  
3\. Make thy gold multiply  
4\. Guard thy treasures from loss  
5\. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment  
6\. Insure a future income  
7\. Increase thy ability to earn  
Our prosperity as a nation depends upon the personal financial prosperity of each of us as individuals.  
Success means accomplishments as the result of our own efforts and abilities.  
Proper preparation is the key to our success.  
Babylon became the wealthiest city of the ancient world because its citizens were the richest people of their time. They appreciated the value of money. They practiced sound financial principles in acquiring money, keeping money and making their money earn more money. They provided for themselves what we all desire…incomes for the future.  
Money is the medium by which earthly success is measured.  
Money makes possible the enjoyment of the best the earth affords. Money is plentiful for those who understand the simple laws which govern its acquisition. Money is governed today by the same laws which controlled it when prosperous men thronged the streets of Babylon, six thousand years ago.  
“Nonsense,” reproved Kobbi, “a man’s wealth is not in the purse he carries. A fat purse quickly empties if there be no golden stream to refill it.  
“I wish an income that will keep flowing into my purse whether I sit upon the wall or travel to far lands.  
“In my youth I looked about me and saw all the good things there were to bring happiness and contentment. And I realized that wealth increased the potency of all these. Wealth is a power. With wealth many things are possible.  
I decided that if I was to achieve what I desired, time and study would be required.  
the sun that shines today is the sun that shone when thy father was born, and will still be shining when thy last grandchild shall pass into the darkness.  
‘I found the road to wealth when I decided that a part of all I earned was mine to keep. And so will you.’  
‘Every gold piece you save is a slave to work for you. Every copper it earns is its child that also can earn for you. If you would become wealthy, then what you save must earn, and its children must earn, that all may help to give to you the abundance you crave.  
Part of all you earn is yours to keep. It should be not less than a tenth no matter how little you earn. It can be as much more as you can afford. Pay yourself first. Do not buy from the clothes-maker and the sandal-maker more than you can pay out of the rest and still have enough for food and charity and penance to the gods.  
Wealth, like a tree, grows from a tiny seed. The first copper you save is the seed from which your tree of wealth shall grow. The sooner you plant that seed the sooner shall the tree grow. And the more faithfully you nourish and water that tree with consistent savings, the sooner may you bask in contentment beneath its shade.’  
Advice is one thing that is freely given away, but watch that you take only what is worth having.  
He who takes advice about his savings from one who is inexperienced in such matters, shall pay with his savings for proving the falsity of their opinions.’  
‘You have learned your lessons well. You first learned to live upon less than you could earn. Next you learned to seek advice from those who were competent through their own experiences to give it. And, lastly, you have learned to make gold work for you.  
You have taught yourself how to acquire money, how to keep it, and how to use it.  
“Wealth grows wherever men exert energy,”  
‘A part of all I earn is mine to keep.’  
“Then learn to make your treasure work for you. Make it your slave. Make its children and its children’s children work for you.
