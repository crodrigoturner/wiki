Robert Conquest is known for his «Three Laws of Politics», which were not published by him at any point, but which he is noted as having regularly used in conversation, and which have since been published in reference by other authors. These are:

1\. Everyone is conservative about what he knows best.

2\. Any organization not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing.

3\. The simplest way to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it is controlled by a cabal of its enemies.
