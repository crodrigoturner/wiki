Some highly capable people, such as Elon Musk and [Nick Bostrom](https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html), believe that we could be living in a simulation. This is to say, that we could be currently living inside a sort of video game, in a server in some higher species' IT room.

I'm on the fence about it, but the more I think about, the more I think it could be feasable.

The hypothesis goes as follows: 

1. We humans have been living for around 200000 years as Homo Sapiens [(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human).

2. In the last couple of decades, videogames have improved drastically. Just think how far we've gone from the first videogames such as PONG to the current VR games, such as Cyberpunk 2077. 

3. If we were to expand the current rate of improvement another couple of hundred or thousand years, we could be able to develop something that very much looks like our live.

But is there a way to actually know? 

What I am feeling while writing this post seems real but, again, how can I actually know? I'll keep thinking about it, trying to find out. 

The next question though, is what if I am in a simulation? is it relevant? does that make my life less meaningful? If the technology is so advanced that I can no longer distinguish between reality and a simulation... Would I mind living in a computer while my physical body is no longer attached?
