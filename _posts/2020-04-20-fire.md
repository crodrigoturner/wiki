Here are some basic principles of the F.I.R.E movement:

1. Radically reduce your spending.
2. Become debt-free.
3. Aggressively pay off your loans.
4. Ideally, no mortgage.
5. Save as much as you can, and invest those savings safely.
6. Become an entrepreneur, start or buy a small business.
7. Retire early, often, or not at all.
