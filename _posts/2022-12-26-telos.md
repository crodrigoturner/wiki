Telos is a term used by philosopher Aristotle to refer to the final cause of a natural organ or entity, or of a work of human art. Intentional actualization of potential or inherent purpose, similar to the notion of an ‘end goal’ or ‘raison d’être’. Moreover, **it can be understood as the «supreme end of man’s endeavour»**.
