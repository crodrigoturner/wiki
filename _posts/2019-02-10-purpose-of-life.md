The purpose of life is right in front of us: **It’s to create a reality we want to inhabit — to reach towards the better end of our conscious experience.** At each moment, in every second of life, we are given a choice about how we want to conduct ourselves in this world, and though it might not always seem like it, each of these choices are of consequence. They each interact with culture to give it a new form; a form that we are responsible for creating by either doing what is right or doing what is wrong in that specific moment.
