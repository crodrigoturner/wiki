https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_inattention

Civil inattention is the process whereby strangers who are in close proximity demonstrate that they are aware of one another, without imposing on each other â€“ a recognition of the claims of others to a public space, and of their own personal boundaries.[1]
