In 1726, at the age of 20, Benjamin Franklin created a system to develop his character.   
In his autobiography, Franklin listed his thirteen virtues as:  
1\. **Temperance**: Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.  
2\. **Silence**: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.  
3\. **Order**: Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.  
4\. **Resolution**: Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.  
5\. **Frugality**: Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.  
6\. **Industry**: Lose no time; be always employ’d in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.  
7\. **Sincerity**: Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.  
8\. **Justice**: Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.  
9\. **Moderation**: Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.  
10\. **Cleanliness**: Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.  
11\. **Tranquillity**: Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.  
12\. **Chastity**: Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another’s peace or reputation.  
13\. **Humility**: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.
