When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.  
The Cobra Effect is the perfect example of incentives that back fire.  
There’s a famous story of British colonialists trying to reduce the snake population in India.  
They offered bounties for dead cobras with cash given out to the killers.  
The incentives back-fired…  
The local population started breeding cobras &amp; killing them.  
When the government discovered this, the reward programme was scrapped.  
The cobra breeders then released their $0 snakes into the street, making the problem much worse.
