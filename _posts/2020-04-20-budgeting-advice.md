> A lot of budgeting starts at the edges and works in “cut back here” and “trim over there.” That’s a little like planning a diet by saying “cut out cookies” and “no sugar in your coffee.” This approach may (or may not) work for slight modifications, but it is not a comprehensive lifetime plan. And if you don’t have a master plan, then trimming a few expenses in one place while you overspend elsewhere won’t do you any more good than cutting out doughnuts while you gorge on cupcakes.

We start by approaching money in a whole new way. No complicated lists. No spending diaries. Instead, (...) analyze your spending by dividing it into three simple categories. 

There is one category for your regular monthly bills.  
A second category for the money you spend “just for fun”.
And a third category for savings.

Those three categories make up the 50/30/20 budget: 

50 percent of your money goes toward needs, or Must Haves (housing, transportation, food, bills).  
30 percent goes to discretionary spending or Wants.  
20 percent goes to Savings.
