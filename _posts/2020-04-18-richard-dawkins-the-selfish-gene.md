Written by Richard Dawkins 

Evolution is driven by varying abilities and limited resources.

The Selfish Gene is a landmark 1976 work in the field of biology: It puts the gene at the center of the process of evolution and explains how, when this is taken into account, genes must be seen as "selfish."

Author Richard Dawkins then uses this theory of gene selfishness to explain the massive variety of animal behavior observable on Earth.
