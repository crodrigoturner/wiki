### ¿Por que las plantas son verdes?

La luz solar es muy rica en fotones de luz roja y menos en los fotones más energéticos, los azules. Los fotones de energía intermedia (los verdes), no son ni muy energéticos, ni abundantes. Las clorofilas (moléculas responsables del color de las plantas y, lo que es más importante, las verdaderas «inventoras» de la fotosíntesis) están «enfocadas» en capturar esa parte del espectro solar más abundante (la roja) y la más energética (la azul): por eso nosotros vemos las clorofilas de color verde.

### ¿Por qué el cielo es azul?

Lo que tú ves es la luz del sol que se refleja en la capa de aire que hay sobre nosotros y que recubre la Tierra. La luz del sol, en realidad, tiene los mismos colores que el arcoíris. ¿Muchos verdad? Para que la luz del sol llegue hasta nosotros, tiene que cruzar esa capa de aire. Hay colores muy valientes que consiguen cruzar y llegar a nosotros y otros, que son más torpecillos y no lo consiguen. Ese es el caso del color azul que no consigue cruzar y se queda allí atrapado en el aire. Y eso es lo que nosotros vemos, la luz azul del sol que se queda atrapada en el aire.

### Classification of living beings 

### The cycle of life

### Diferencia en el material genético

Nuestro material genético es prácticamente idéntico al de otros animales. En el caso de los chimpancés, solo se diferencia en un 2%, un 10% en el caso de los gatos, un 18% en de los perros...

Si nos centramos en el caso de los chimpancés, llegamos a la conclusión de que es  esa diferencia del 2% la que nos hace humanos.

Nuestra inteligencia, nuestra forma de sentir, nuestras ambiciones... todo ello está contenido en ese pequeño 2%. Gracias a esa insignificante diferencia podemos levantar rascacielos, lanzar cohetes, componer melodías y sobre todo, estar en lo más alto de la jerarquía animal.

Por eso, da qué pensar que si alguna vez nos visitarán otro planeta y su material genético fuera muy diferente al nuestro, podríamos perder nuestro puesto hegemónico.

### Photosynthesis 

### Earth's critical zone

Heterogeneous near surface environment in which complex interactions involving rock, soil, water, air, and living organisms regulate the natural habitat and determine the availability of life-sustaining resources. (National Research Council, 2001). 

The Critical Zone, surface and near-surface environment, sustains nearly all terrestrial life.

### Biomimicry
Imitation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex human problems

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics)[s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics)

**Some examples of Biomimicry:**

Early examples of biomimicry are found in Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches for flying machines and in the work of Filippo Brunelleschi: after studying the strength of eggshells, the Renaissance architect designed a thinner, lighter dome for his cathedral in Florence, completed in 1436.

Later, in 1719, paper producers shifted from using cotton and linen fibres after French entomologist Réne-Antoine Réaumur suggested the wasp’s use of wood pulp in nest-building demonstrated a better alternative.

In 1809, naval architect Sir George Cayley studied dolphins to make ships’ hulls more streamlined.

Yet perhaps the most famous example of biomimicry came in 1948 when Swiss engineer George de Mestral walked his dog: it emerged from the bushes covered in burrs. After examining the burrs’ tiny hooks under a magnifying glass, he designed Velcro.

Biological organisms have already provided solutions in areas such as zero-waste systems, low-temperature manufacturing and efficient materials and structures.

Advances in scientific knowledge, manufacturing technology and digital design tools make now the moment to embrace biomimicry.

### Tipos de Civilización
In the excellent book entitled, "Hyperspace", theorical physicist Michio Kaku mentioned about three kinds of civilizations: Type 1, 2, & 3 Civilizations

Type I – this civilization harnesses the energy output of an entire planet.

Type II – this civilization harnesses the energy output of a star, and generates about 10 billion times the energy output of a Type I civilization.

Type III – this civilization harnesses the energy output of a galaxy, or about 10 billion time the energy output of a Type II civilization.

A Type I civilization would be able to manipulate truly planetary energies. They might, for example, control or modify their weather. They would have the power to manipulate planetary phenomena, such as hurricanes, which can release the energy of hundreds of hydrogen bombs. Perhaps volcanoes or even earthquakes may be altered by such a civilization.

A Type II civilization may resemble the Federation of Planets seen on the TV program Star Trek (which is capable of igniting stars and has colonized a tiny fraction of the near-by stars in the galaxy). A Type II civilization might be able to manipulate the power of solar flares.

A Type III civilization may resemble the Borg, or perhaps the Empire found in the Star Wars saga. They have colonized the galaxy itself, extracting energy from hundreds of billions of stars.

By contrast, we are a Type 0 civilization, which extracts its energy from dead plants (oil and coal). Growing at the average rate of about 3% per year, however, one may calculate that our own civilization may attain Type I status in about 100-200 years, Type II status in a few thousand years, and Type III status in about 100,000 to a million years. These time scales are insignificant when compared with the universe itself. On this scale, one may now rank the different propulsion systems available to different types of civilizations: Type 0 Chemical rockets Ionic engines Fission power EM propulsion (rail guns) Type I Ram-jet fusion engines Photonic drive Type II Antimatter drive Von Neumann nano probes Type III Planck energy propulsion It's encouraging to know that we will reach Type 1 within one hundred years, but how about Type 2? Michio Kaku stated that it would take several thousands of years.

We have reached a turning point in society. According to renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku, the next 100 years of science will determine whether we perish or thrive. Will we remain a Type 0 civilization, or will we advance and make our way into the stars?

Experts assert that, as a civilization grows larger and becomes more advanced, its energy demands will increase rapidly due to its population growth and the energy requirements of its various machines. With this in mind, the Kardashev scale was developed as a way of measuring a civilization’s technological advancement based upon how much usable energy it has at its disposal (this was originally just tied to energy available for communications, but has since been expanded).

MEET THE KARDASHEV SCALE

The scale was originally designed in 1964 by the Russian astrophysicist  Nikolai Kardashev (who was looking for signs of extraterrestrial life within cosmic signals). It has 3 base classes, each with an energy disposal level: Type I (10¹⁶W), Type II (10²⁶W), and Type III (10³⁶W). Other astronomers have extended the scale to Type IV (10⁴⁶W) and Type V (the energy available to this kind of civilization would equal that of all energy available in not just our universe, but in all universes and in all time-lines). These additions consider both energy access as well as the amount of knowledge the civilizations have access to.

First, it is important to note that the human race is not even on this scale yet. Since we still sustain our energy needs from dead plants and animals, here on Earth, we are a lowly Type 0 civilization (and we have a LONG way to go before being promoted to a type I civilization). Kaku tends to believe that, all things taken into consideration, we will reach Type I in 100 – 200 years time. But what does each of these categories actually stand for in literal terms?

A Type I designation is a given to species who have been able to harness all the energy that is available from a neighboring star, gathering and storing it to meet the energy demands of a growing population. This means that we would need to boost our current energy production over 100,000 times to reach this status. However, being able to harness all Earth’s energy would also mean that we could have control over all natural forces. Human beings could control volcanoes, the weather, and even earthquakes! (At least, that is the idea.) These kinds of feats are hard to believe, but compared to the advances that may still be to come, these are just basic and primitive levels of control (it’s absolutely nothing compared to the capabilities of societies with higher rankings).

The next step up – a Type II civilization – can harness the power of their entire star (not merely transforming starlight into energy, but controlling the star). Several methods for this have been proposed. The most popular of which is the hypothetical ‘Dyson Sphere.’ This device, if you want to call it that, would encompass every single inch of the star, gathering most (if not all) of its energy output and transferring it to a planet for later use. Alternatively, if fusion power (the mechanism that powers stars) had been mastered by the race, a reactor on a truly immense scale could be used to satisfy their needs. Nearby gas giants can be utilized for their hydrogen, slowly drained of life by an orbiting reactor.

What would this much energy mean for a species? Well, nothing known to science could wipe out a Type II civilization. Take, for instance, if humans survived long enough to reach this status, and a moon sized object entered our solar system on a collision course with our little blue planet–we’d have the ability to vaporize it out of existence. Or if we had time, we could move our planet out of the way, completely dodging it. But let’s say we didn’t want to move Earth… are there any other options? Well yes, because we’d have the capability to move Jupiter, or another planet of our choice, into the way – pretty cool, right?

So we’ve gone from having control over a planet, to a star, which has resulted in us harboring enough “disposable” energy to essentially make our civilization immune to extinction. But now, onto Type III, where a species then becomes galactic traversers with knowledge of everything having to do with energy, resulting in them becoming a master race.  In terms of humans, hundreds of thousands of years of evolution – both biological and mechanical – may result in the inhabitants of this type III civilization being incredibly different from the human race as we know it. These may be cyborgs (or cybernetic organism, beings both biological and robotic), with the descendants of regular humans being a sub-species among the now-highly advanced society. These wholly biological humans would likely be seen as being disabled, inferior, or unevolved by their cybernetic counterparts.

At this stage, we would have developed colonies of robots that are capable of ‘self replication’; their population may increase into the millions as they spread out across the galaxy, colonizing star after star. And these being might build Dyson Spheres to encapsulate each one, creating a huge network that would carry energy back to the home planet. But stretching over the galaxy in such a manner would face several problems; namely, the species would be constrained by the laws of physics. Particularly, light-speed travel. That is, unless they develop a working warp drive, or use that immaculate energy cache to master wormhole teleportation (two things that remain theoretical for the time being), they can only get so far.

Kardashev believed a Type IV civilization was ‘too’ advanced and didn’t go beyond Type III on his scale. He thought that, surely, this would be the extent of any species’ ability. Many think so, but a few believe there is a further level that could be achieved. (I mean, surely there is a limit?) Type IV civilizations would almost be able to harness the energy content of the entire universe and with that, they could traverse the accelerating expansion of space (furthermore, advance races of these species may live inside supermassive black holes). To previous methods of generating energy, these kinds of feats are considered impossible. A Type IV civilization would need to tap into energy sources unknown to us using strange, or currently unknown, laws of physics.

Type V. Yes, Type V might just be the next possible advancement to such a civilization. Here beings would be like gods, having the knowledge to manipulate the universe as they please. Now, as I said, humans are a very, very long way from ever reaching anything like this. But it’s not to say that it cannot be achieved as long as we take care of Earth and each other. To do so, the first step is to preserve our tiny home, extinguish war, and continue to support scientific advances and discoveries.
