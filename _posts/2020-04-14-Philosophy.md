### Ikigai
Japanese concept that means **"a reason for being." **It is similar to the French phrase Raison d'être. 

Everyone, according to Japanese culture, has an ikigai. 

Finding it requires a deep and often lengthy search of self. 

Such a search is important to the cultural belief that discovering one's ikigai brings satisfaction and meaning to life.

For some, it might be work, hobbies and raising children.
