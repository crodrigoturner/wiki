1\. Thou shalt not attack the person’s character, but the argument. (Ad hominem)  
2\. Thou shalt not misrepresent or exaggerate a person’s argument in order to make it easier to attack. (Straw man fallacy)  
3\. Thou shalt not use small numbers to represent the all. (Hasty generalisation)  
4\. Thou shalt not argue thy position by assuming one of its premises is true. (Begging the question)  
5\. Thou shalt not claim that because something occured before, it must be the cause. (Post hoc/False cause)  
6\. Thou shalt not reduce the argument down to two possibillities. (False dichotomy)  
7\. Thou shalt not argue that because of our ignorance, a claim must be true or false. (Ad ignoraturum)  
8\. Thou shalt not lay the burden of proof onto him that is questioning the claim. (Burden of proof reversal)  
9\. Thou shalt not assume «this» follows «that» when there is no logical connection. (Non sequitur)  
10\. Thou shalt not argue that because a premise is popular, therefore it must be true. (Bandwagon fallacy)
