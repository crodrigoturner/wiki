Churchill “was a man of action: state the problem, find a solution, and solve the problem.”

Constantin Brancuși’s maxim that to live a fulfilling, flourishing life, one must “Work like a slave; command like a king; create like a god.”

> Anger is a waste of energy. Steam which is used to blow off a safety valve would be better used to drive an engine.

Churchill's appetite for learning grew, he began to read three or four books at a time to avoid tedium" and to explore a wide variety of subjects and authors. Manchester details his program of study:
"he was poring over Schopenhauer, Malthus, Darwin, Aristotle (on politics only), Henry Fawcett's Political Economy, William Lecky's European Morals and Rise and Influence of Rationalism, Pascal's Provincial Letters, Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, Liang's Modern Science and Modern Thought, Victor-Henri Rochefort's Memoirs, the memoirs of the Duc de Saint Simon, and Henry Hallam's Constitutional History. Incredibly, he asked his mother to send him all one hundred volumes of the Annual Register, the record of British public events founded by Burke. He explained that he wanted to know 'the detailed Parliamentary history...of the last 100 years...'

Churchill was a man of action: "state the problem, find a solution, and solve the problem."
